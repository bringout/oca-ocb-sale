# Digital Products


Sell e-goods in your eCommerce store (e.g. webinars, articles, e-books, video tutorials).
To do so, create the product and attach the file to share via the *Files* button of the product form.
Once the order is paid, the file is made available in the order confirmation page and in the customer portal.
